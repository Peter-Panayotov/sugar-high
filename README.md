# sugar-high explanation

The values of the input array are stored in a HashMap (the amount of sugar in the candies are the keys and indices are the values of the HashMap). In case there are duplicate values their indices are stored in an ArrayList. The using of a HashMap is done to reduce the iterations of the initial array later, so I can have the indices and can reach them directly using the keys of the map. The input array is sorted then iterated and the amount of sugar is added on every iteration to variable "currentThreshold" until the value of the variable reaches the threshold. When this moment occurs, "break" statement stops the loop and the value in the "currentThreshold" is the maximum amount of sugar that can be reached before the threshold. On every iteration the current index is added in the "result" ArrayList so the list can be returned in the end. After the end of the loop all the indices of the candies that can be eaten are in the "result" ArrayList, which is finally sorted and returned as an array.
